mpg -- Miles/(US) gallon
cyl -- Number of cylinders
disp -- Displacement (cu.in.)
hp -- Gross horsepower
drat -- Rear axle ratio
wt -- Weight (lb/1000)
qsec -- 1/4 mile time
vs -- V/S engine.
am -- Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
gear -- Number of forward gears
carb -- Number of carburetors
Notice that adding more aesthetics to your plot is not always a good idea. Adding aesthetic mappings to
a plot will increase its complexity, and thus decrease its readability.

The mtcars dataset contains information about 32 cars from 1973 Motor 
Trend magazine. This dataset is small, intuitive, and contains a
variety of continuous and categorical variables.
